Here’s the clean court flow you can keep by your keyboard:
	1.	Case called / appearances
	•	You: "Good morning, Your Honor. [Name], defendant, present."
	2.	Officer present?
	•	No: "Your Honor, is the State’s witness present? If not, I move to dismiss for lack of prosecution."
	•	If prosecutor asks to continue: "I oppose. Petty case; State had notice. Please dismiss. If continued, please set a final date certain and require advance disclosure of any records."
	•	Yes: Proceed.
	3.	Prosecution’s case (officer testifies)
	•	Listen for: lights "were flashing,"  473-ft lock, where you were relative to BEGIN sign.
	4.	Your cross-examination (yes/no, tight)
	•	"At the exact lock-moment, the BEGIN beacon was flashing--correct?"
	•	"You personally saw the beacon head flashing then--correct?"
	•	"For how many seconds before/after the lock did you see it flashing?"
	•	"From your position, you could see the beacon head at the lock--yes?"
	•	"Please mark on Exhibit A where you were and where my vehicle was at the 473-ft lock."
	•	"How far past the BEGIN sign was my vehicle at that instant?"
	•	"You have no video of the beacon ON at that second--correct?"
	•	"You reviewed no County on/off log for that minute--correct?"
	•	"You don’t know whether the beacon controller’s internal clock was synchronized to the citation/dispatch time--correct?"
	•	"No further questions, Your Honor."
	5.	Your presentation (brief)
	•	Mini-opening (20–30s): "The sign is ‘WHEN FLASHING.’ The State must prove ON at the lock-second and inside-zone placement. There’s no video, no logs, controller uses internal clock; stop was past END; minutes later beacon OFF."
	•	Show exhibits in order:
A map (BEGIN/END, officer, 473 ft, CVS), B BEGIN sign, C END/50 MPH, D timeline, E County emails (no logs/internal clock).
	•	Foundation line: "These are my photos; they fairly depict the location and signs."
	6.	Closings
	•	You (≈20s): "The State didn’t prove the beacons were ON at the lock-second or that my 473-ft lock was inside the zone. With no logs, no video, and an unsynchronized internal clock, timing and placement aren’t proven. Outside the zone the posted limit is 50 MPH. I request dismissal; alternatively, a brief continuance for a records custodian."
	7.	Ruling / contingencies
	•	If judge says ticket + testimony is enough:
"For the record, which evidence establishes ON at the exact lock-second and 473-ft past BEGIN? There’s no video/log and no clock-sync evidence."
	•	If still overruled: request to amend to non-school-zone or continuance for dismissal/stay.
	8.	If continued
	•	Ask for final continuance, date certain, and State disclosure (beacon schedule/logs, video, LIDAR checks).

That’s the whole flow, end-to-end.
