Subject: Recurring Tab Updates + Showing "Date Last Saved" in File Explorer (No Need for Dates in File Names)

Hi [Boss],

Two things for you:

1. RECURRING TAB UPDATES
2. "DATE LAST SAVED" — HOW TO SEE IT IN FILE EXPLORER (BETTER THAN DATES IN FILE NAMES)

────────────────────────────────────
1. RECURRING TAB UPDATES
────────────────────────────────────

I rebuilt the Recurring tab in the Project Tracking workbook with some major improvements:

• Rolling 6-month columns (current month + 5 forward) — automatically stays current
• Per-deliverable tracking: GV Day, Preparer, Reviewed By, and Distributed Date for each month
• Color-coded status at a glance:
    - RED    = Overdue (not distributed and past due date)
    - YELLOW = Due within 3 days
    - GREEN  = Distributed (fill in the date and it turns green automatically)
• Freeze panes so the deliverable names stay visible while scrolling through months
• Auto-filter on headers for quick sorting/filtering
• Clean RBC navy/blue theme throughout

To use it:
- Just fill in the "Distributed Date" cell when a report goes out → it turns GREEN automatically
- "Preparer" defaults to the Owner — update as needed
- "Reviewed By" is blank — fill in as appropriate
- Due dates are calculated from the GV Day field

The script that generates this is saved in our shared repo if we ever need to rebuild or modify it.

2. SHOWING "DATE LAST SAVED" IN FILE EXPLORER
────────────────────────────────────

Rather than putting dates in file names (e.g., "Report_02-24-2026.xlsx"), Windows has a built-in way to see when any file was last saved — right in the folder view. This is actually better because:

• File names stay clean and consistent
• The date updates AUTOMATICALLY every time the file is saved (no manual renaming)
• You can sort and filter by date with one click
• No risk of someone forgetting to update the date in the file name

Here's how to set it up (takes about 30 seconds):

STEP 1: Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder
STEP 2: Make sure you're in "Details" view
         → Click View (in the toolbar/ribbon) → Details
STEP 3: Right-click any column header (e.g., "Name" or "Date modified")
STEP 4: Click "More..." at the bottom of the dropdown
STEP 5: In the "Choose Details" window, scroll down and check ☑ "Date last saved"
         (You can also add "Date created" or "Last printed" if useful)
STEP 6: Click OK

You'll now see a "Date last saved" column showing the exact date/time each file was last saved — no manual effort required.

TO APPLY THIS VIEW TO ALL FOLDERS (so you only do this once):
→ File → Options → View tab → Click "Apply to Folders" → OK

This pulls the "Date last saved" directly from the file's metadata (the same info you see when you right-click a file → Properties → Details tab). It's the most reliable way to track when files were last touched.

BONUS: You can click the "Date last saved" column header to sort files by most recently saved — makes it very easy to find what was worked on today.

Let me know if you have any questions or want me to walk through it with you.

Best,
David
