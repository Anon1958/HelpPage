CASH SWEEP FORECAST

1. General Items
	•	Do not change any core approach without first notifying Eric.
	•	A more formal model is needed to understand how this forecast works before adding it to the main workbook or broader circulation.

2. Purpose & Key Considerations
	•	Primary Goal: Provide a well-informed forecast of cash sweep balances and related revenues.

Forecast Focus:
	•	Balances
	•	Revenue
	•	Earn (interest) rates

3. Next Steps & Model Improvements
	1.	Reconciliations
	•	Confirm that balances are accurate and reflect recent changes (e.g., booking location shifts).
	•	Identify whether interest rate changes or recruiting efforts (increased AUA) drive the forecast movements.
	2.	Forecast Methodology
	•	Evaluate the short-term vs. long-term approach.
	•	Consider performing a quick sensitivity analysis on interest rates or growth assumptions.
	3.	RBC Bank & Other Breakouts
	•	Potentially break out RBC data separately for clarity.
	•	Evaluate whether RBC rates are higher or lower than other rates and how that impacts the overall forecast.
	4.	Splitting by Segments
	•	Advisory vs. Brokerage: Understand if/how these segments differ in terms of rates or balances.

4. Detailed Forecast Mechanics
	•	Interest Rate Assumptions
	•	We may need different scenarios for potential rate cuts or increases.
	•	Understand how the "earn rate" changes from month to month and tie it back to actual drivers.
	•	Balances & Revenue Drivers
	•	Determine if balances or rates are the primary movers of revenue in each scenario.
	•	If new money flows in, how do we incorporate it (versus assuming static balances)?
	•	Input Tab / Data Sources
	•	Keep an input tab with clear, "spot-value" entries for forecasting.
	•	Decide whether a detailed monthly forecast is needed or if a simpler approach (e.g., single "plug" for new money) suffices.

5. Recap Section
	•	Balances, Revenue, Earn Rate are the key outputs.
	•	The budget is already near completion; this forecast is independent of the formal budget cycle.
	•	A RECAP page may be added if it helps clarify which factors are moving the forecast (rates vs. balances).

6. Items to Remove or Avoid
	•	Unnecessary Sheets: Avoid adding too many new sheets to the workbook.
	•	Example: Tractorat 1.2 Billion: Confirm if this is still relevant or should be removed.
	•	Excess RBC Detail: Keep RBC lines consolidated unless a deeper breakdown is essential.

7. Open Questions
	•	Why is AUA increasing? Is it due to recruiting, market performance, or another factor?
	•	How do booking location changes (e.g., RBC national vs. RBC bank) affect the forecast?
	•	Do we need to run multiple "what-if" scenarios to capture potential rate volatility?

Overall, the key is to maintain a straightforward, transparent forecasting approach that highlights the primary drivers (balances vs. rates) while providing enough detail to explain month-to-month changes.
