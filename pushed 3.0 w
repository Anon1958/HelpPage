At Wharton, I want to be the kind of classmate who makes teams stronger and helps people do their best work: grounded, dependable, and generous with time and tools.

My foundation comes from being a varsity student-athlete. That experience taught me how to show up consistently, take coaching without defensiveness, and stay calm when the stakes are high. It also taught me how to support others quietly, not just compete. In team settings, I’m the person who prepares early, communicates clearly, and follows through so no one is left carrying the load at the last minute. At Wharton, I plan to bring that same energy to learning teams and student organizations, and I also want to be part of the community that supports student-athletes who are balancing demanding schedules, recruiting, and big career transitions.

As a CFA charterholder, I bring a disciplined, ethical approach to finance. I care about getting to the truth of an argument: what assumptions it depends on, how risk shows up in outcomes, and what a decision looks like when it meets reality. In the classroom, I’ll contribute by asking thoughtful questions, helping discussions stay grounded in evidence, and supporting peers who want a sharper structure for their analysis or a clearer way to communicate a point.

I also bring a practical technology skill set, especially in AI and data analytics. I enjoy taking messy information and turning it into something usable, whether that’s a cleaner model, a clearer dashboard, or a workflow that saves time and reduces errors. At Wharton, I’d love to host small, informal working sessions for classmates who want to use AI responsibly in finance. Not theory, but real help. Bring a dataset, a research task, or a process that’s taking too long, and we’ll turn it into something clearer and more efficient while staying mindful of accuracy, bias, and good judgment.

What I’m most excited about is the culture Wharton is known for: ambitious, collaborative, and high trust. My goal is to contribute to that culture by being a reliable teammate, a steady presence under pressure, and someone who helps others turn strong ideas into real results.
